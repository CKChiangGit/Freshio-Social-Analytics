Atmosphere was naturally crowds timing  and your decision to join Q, but shouldn't be under rated,
Food-Flavors of 20 on display and rotational changes monthly. 
Our Pistachio are purely Sicilian and strong mix ratio which gives a earthly dense taste. At $5.50/scoop it's our Top seller flavor. Again under rated😔

Allows 5 mins to defrost and savor. Spread the Gelato onto your tongue to even out. The true taste and texture feeling will tells the quality of the Gelato. We certainly look forward to your visit again.

Freshio Gelato offers any flavor for tasting on display, many a customer continue to taste each flavor offered for our texture and flavor quality. Pistachio, Hazelnut, Ferrero Rocher .......one after another is good, It's curiousity and uncertainty which is 'not to one's expectations ' as like you said, all are flavorful, smooth silky texture.
At 70's Gelato Cafe are no hectic work, but the long hours in F&B requires for food safety and a passion in work to produce quality.
Many a customer like yourself becomes friends with us. We appreciated very well your humbleness and kindness towards the elderly.

But churning out Gelato with flavours and sweetness has been more then work, a passion and satisfaction. It's a pat on your own back and pride.
