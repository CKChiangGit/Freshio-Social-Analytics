This past Sunday, we had the opportunity to do our first pop up event at @merelyicecream. What a wonderful real life entrepreneurship learning experience it was for them. Prior to the event, we discussed marketing strategies such as providing free samples of our sourdough (generously) and free flow ice cream toppings to entice customers to our table, pricing strategies, speaking up to explain our offerings, good customer service etiquette, and good hygiene when handling food (wear gloves, etc.). 

We had so many things to prepare and bring, down to tissue paper, extra cooking utensils in case things drop/get dirty, trash can, etc. My sister and I, with three children took a taxi, carrying 4 heavy laundry baskets full of things and a baby stroller (to help us carry some of the things). Lol. I wish we took a picture for memories' sake (totally forgot because we were so busy), because the transport itself was an adventure. 

Six hours at the pop up went by really quickly and we truly enjoyed doing this together as a family. Afterwards when we reflected on the day, I asked the children what they learned and things they could improve on, and we shared our experiences. This, to me, was the invaluable lesson that made all the intense and hectic preparations worthwhile. 

Thank you again for the opportunity, YW and @lyyeow! And thank you everyone who came to support us! What a precious memory.","Oishii Ferments","oishiiferments","https://www.instagram.com/p/CxsLPG6yEEH/","5","I'm sure your family had a wonderful experience!

- Not the airiest but sufficiently crispy within the first few bites. 
- Wasn’t too sweet which complemented the sweetness of the ice cream. [7.5/10]

美丽俱乐部LIVE SILKSCREEN 

I have been a hermit and stayed away from events for years, only crawling out of my shell for @merelyicecream last hurrah. A special tee to mark the end of 11 years for my favourite ice cream store. It has given me all the most beautiful things I can ever wish for - the best ice cream, the cutest cat, my loveliest husband and so much love. 

All ready for this Sunday’s live silkscreen. 美丽的你，我们不见不散！🍦","Ly Yeow","lyyeow","https://www.instagram.com/p/Cxam90nySGs/","1","can't go... need to work.. me sad... 😢","32","2023-09-20T13:49:52.000Z",

1: sourdough egg tarts and strawberry yuzu danish. i posted about the egg tarts before so i’ll just talk about the danish, the strawberries were sweet (luckily) and the yuzu filling was tangy hehe 

2-3: made my own bowl comprising of brown rice, soy-marinated tofu, corn, shiitake mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, mentaiko and sesame soy dressing. i haven’t eaten from here in so long but i still consider this place one of my favourites, and i would say the given amount of mentaiko became more generous HAHA 

4-5: lemon delight (with lemon jam), fragola (strawberry) and mixed berries (raspberry, blueberry, blackberry and red currant). very refreshing. the three flavours together gave me summer season vibes for some reason 

6-7: visited on 20/9 before they ceased operations on 24/9. the last time i visited was a couple of years ago and i knew i wouldn’t have time to go again before 24/9 so i got a triple scoop! go big or go home right… i got valrhona chocolate, salted butterscotch and pandan crumble while my friend got hojicha! 

8: chocoladen (chocolatey danish pastry with a chocolate bar inside). nice sweet treats :] 

9-10: my mum came here with her friends before so she brought me here for me to try their food ~ there’s an all-you-can-eat salad bar available with each main course order so we both got a main and salad (its not just vegetables, there’s other food side dishes too). the main course (i got chargrilled sirloin) may look little but the salad bar items made up for it (i think if the main course came with many other things, i wouldn’t be able to fully enjoy the salad bar). my favourites from the salad bar were the sweet potato fries and tofu (slightly firm/crispy on the outside and soft inside)!!","","toomuchsucrose","https://www.instagram.com/p/Cx23wx4yYE2/","13","what a SPREADDD 🔥","-1","2023-10-01T13:10:02.000Z",

Join me at Merely’s last party before doors closed. My favourite ice cream place is closing after 11 good years. I’ve held my first public workshop here almost 10 years back when starting on my art making journey. It feels special running another pop up this time round, with a special design for Merely, to remember all the beautiful moments shared here. 

We have a little silkscreen booth set up outside Merely on 24 Sept, together with good friends like @oishiiferments, @eccommune and more. Printing on uniqlo tshirts so sizing are universal. Live printing on shirt is $30 each. Please pray for sun and allow time for to dry, or top up $2 and I will mail it to you after! Kindly allow imperfections in printing because I am an imperfect human, but we will all be really 美丽 wearing these tees I promise.

After all, Singapore’s sun is much more bearable with these sweet creamy creations.

Luckily for us, the island has an abundance of ice cream shops to visit, comprising rows of decadent flavours ranging from classic chocolate to earl grey butterscotch. To help in your hunt for a sweet scoop, we asked the team at Tatler Singapore to share their favourite ice cream parlours to visit to cool down from the blistering heat.

Find out more about the ice cream parlours that offer sinfully delicious sweet creations that are worth melting for.","Tatler Dining Singapore","tatlerdiningsg","https://www.instagram.com/p/Csn7EG9OuhB/","1","#tatlerdining #tatlerdiningsg #sgfood #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #sgeats #sgfoodlover #sgfoodtrend #singaporefood #singaporefoodie #food #foodie #instafood #foodphotography #besteatssg #sgbesteats #icecream #icecreamsg #gelato #sgicecream #sgnews #sgig #sgweather #hot #dessert #dessertsg #igsg #singaporeweather #singaporeicecream #cool","56","2023-05-24T11:13:21.000Z",

And so it’s left with 24 days of @merelyicecream. It has been quite a year, watching my other half go through the closure of the first shop, now soon going the second shop. This is also going to be my last window art at this lovely space where we met, where I kickstarted my artist journey and have my first exhibition, where we met Socks and brought her home, where we exchanged vows to be with each other through good times and bad times. 

At home, we sat through the grief of the news, hugged each other tight when tears don’t stop, wished to try harder but honestly, it’s also time to let go and stop fighting so hard for this. 

Reality of putting 11 years of his life in here, there are so many things lost. The headspace, always filled with to dos. Till today, I always remember the moment where we were on the train to Austria years ago and wanted to point out something beautiful for him to see, he was on the phone firefighting and ordering ingredients for the shop, because something ran out. For small business, the person behind it never really rest and stops thinking. And ever since I moved LyttleSpace out, I finally understood how he felt too. Closure of Merely made me more mindful of how I want to live. And now I would push everyone to try to knock off on the dot. To go home, go for dinners, see the sunset in time, experience life out there. Because I am fearful too, if one day the same could happen and what would 11 years means to me then? It cannot be just LyttleSpace, it needs to be full for me to be whole too. 

And he came to a decision to let go. Not fighting anymore to see if it’s possible to reopen a smaller shop, not thinking of an online option, finally not thinking of anything else when Merely serves it’s final scoop on 24 September. Ready to close doors. I guess we will sit through waves of sadness again, yet I am also looking forward for him to live his life and learn new things. Maybe going back to school again to study a new subject 💪🏻

24 days of Merely left. Stock your fridge, fill your bellies, get a Goodbye bag online, come for the closing party! Details coming soon 🍦","Ly Yeow","lyyeow","https://www.instagram.com/p/CwoR8oKymAE/","13","❤️","485","2023-09-01T00:38:50.000Z",

been here soo many times & tried LOTS of flavours as well!
1) red velvet cake ; 8/10
love tht it’s not too sweet, thr was tiny cake bits which elevated the texture !

2) green tea ; 6/10
i felt tht it was a little grainy and the flavour cld be more pronounced 

3) white chocolate; 6.5/10
perfect fr those who loved white choco! it was a little too sweet fr me 😅

4)strawberry red wine ; 6/10
this was a seasonal special! wine taste was q strong but not rlly up my alley haha

perfect fr milo lovers! a flavour tht cant go wrong 😆

9) valrhona chocolate ; 10/10

💌
Eat simi: Triple Scoop
Each how much: $9.50
Eat which store: @merelyicecream 
Eat where: Sunshine Plaza, Bencoolen
💌
🧈 Salted Butterscotch: 3.7/5 
My personal go-to classic adorned with sugary-salty brittles with a caramel-like texture. The ice cream was tad bit icy and could be smoother. 
 
🐼 Horlicks Panda: 3.6/5 
A unique flavour not seen elsewhere. The horlicks was a prominent profile here, rendering a malty sweetness and silky texture. Thankfully, it wasn’t as sinful as I thought it’d be as well.

🍵 Green Tea: 3.8/5 
A creation birthed from the partnership with matchaya, this didn’t fail to impress in terms of its flavour. The matcha was not too astringent and not too sweet, though the ice cream could be denser. This would be a good choice for people who aren’t hard-core matcha.
💌
Basic and creative flavours which doesn’t fail, but doesn’t seem to impress too much either.

Filled with Merely friends coming together, the shop is filled with people like the old days, people sharing stories with me on what this place meant to them in their student days, printing days, dating days and so on. It’s beautiful how this humble ice cream shop is the vessel to many of your stories, of waiting, sadness or happiness. Many relationships were forged over ice cream, and more gathering and exchanges on this very last day. Some of you followed my journey with ice cream man from the start of our get together, seeing the addition of mural and window art that brings you a little smile. 

And all of you who are a part of our 美丽俱乐部，thank you for accepting the imperfections in hand printing. I am usually someone who push for 100% with the allowance of time and space, not possible in this pop up setting, but you guys accepted the imperfect prints with grace and love. 

I am the girl who walked into this store 10 years ago, fell in love with the ice cream, then the man whom I married, ate countless tubs and grew fat, also brought Merely’s street cat home and made her family. Merely is very much like all the humans behind this brand, imperfect and beautiful in all their special ways. Despite all the shortcomings, thank you all for loving Merely and holding it a special place in your hearts. For me, it will be special forever and more.
