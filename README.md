# Freshio-Social-Analytics

## Motivation for project
Freshio Gelato is a dessert cafe run by Uncle K. Tan and his wife, at Sunshine Plaza. Famous for its gelato, Italian paninis, waffles & croffles, Uncle K.T prides himself on Freshio’s range of natural flavours that are handmade daily and makes a great effort to provide his customers with the best customer service. Given this local cafe’s approachability and its proximity to SMU, its business nature as a mom-and-pop store, as well as the presence of a sizeable social media presence with 700+ Instagram followers and 750+ Google Reviews, we believed that our project would be able to make an impact on their business.
Just like any other business, Freshio hopes to grow its customer base. Through interviews with our correspondent, Alex, we realised that he had plans to expand the family business. Alex expressed concerns about the current business sustainability against their competitors and profitability amidst the expansion. 

## Objectives of the project
We agreed that the purpose of this project should primarily consolidate Freshio’s customer base, by improving customer retention rates through increasing overall customer satisfaction. Thus, in order to help Freshio accommodate its growth plans, we identified 3 areas our project could focus on to help improve overall customer satisfaction and retention: 

-	Evaluate its marketing in comparison to its competitors
-	Improve its social media presence 
-	Improve its customer flow and education
